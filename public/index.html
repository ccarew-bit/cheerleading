    <header>Hello, welcome to my website about cheerleading!</header>

    <p>
      I was an allstar cheerleader growing up. from the ages of 7-19 my whole
      world was just cheerleading all the time every day. There alot of
      misconceptions about cheerleaders as far as stereotypes are concerned.
      Cheerleaders are suppose to be ditzy and un skilled objects to look at
      during a football game, which is simply not the case. Cheerleading is the
      number one cause of college sport injuries jjust because of all the skill
      that is involved. Some stunts these girls do are absolutely terrifying and
      defy gravity.
